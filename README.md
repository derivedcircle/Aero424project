To run, download all files in the repository into an empty folder
Then in that folder, create a folder called build

After that use CMAKE with the source code being the folder you downloaded the files to
and the location to build the binaries being the build folder within this folder.

Then hit configure, select your IDE of choice, generate, and open the project
From there, use your IDE to build the code and create the executable.

TLDR: use CMAKE to create project in the standard way we have done for class
