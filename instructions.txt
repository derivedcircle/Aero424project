INSTRUCTIONS TO PLAY:

You are the manager at an aircraft maintanance hanger.
Your job is to fix as many planes as you can and last as long as you can.
If any planes crash, you will loose the game.

Every day, 3 planes will arrive and their pilots will tell you what the issue
is with their plane. For each plane, you will have to decide what the best 
course of action is for the plane from 3 choices, including one option to simply
let the plane go.

Each option will include the cost to perform the maintanance and how many days
it will take to complete (You currently do NOT have the CAPITALISM DLC so you 
unfortunatly have unlimited money. If you would like to get access to capitalism,
please subsribe to the battle pass for 2000 dollars a month)

Multiple options can be correct and you will not find out if you made a wrong choice
until the plane leaves your hangar.

After you are done handling the new arrivals, you will see a display showing the current
day, how much money you have spent, how much hangar space is taken up, and all of the aircrafts
displayed by their ID and how many days they have left of maintanance.

Remember, you will not be able to take in any planes if there is no space in your hanger 
and if any planes crash, you are fired. You may play this game as many times as you like.

WE ARE COUNTING ON YOU... GOOD LUCK <3
